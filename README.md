# Self-Balancing-Robot
The self-balancing robot is an impressive project that combines several key components and principles of robotics. Here are some details about it:

Key Components

ESP32 Microcontroller:
The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It handles the main processing tasks, reads sensor data, and controls the motors.

MPU6050 Sensor:
This is a 6-axis motion tracking device that includes a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. It provides the necessary tilt and angular velocity data required for balancing the robot.

L298N Motor Controller:
The L298N is a dual H-Bridge motor driver that can control the direction and speed of two DC motors. It receives PWM signals from the ESP32 to drive the motors.

DC BO Motors:
These gear motors are responsible for moving the robot. They are powered by the 12V Li-ion battery and controlled by the L298N motor controller.

12V Li-ion Battery:
This battery provides the necessary power to the motors and the ESP32, ensuring the robot has sufficient energy to operate.

Functionality

Self-Balancing:
The primary function of the robot is to maintain its balance using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithm. The MPU6050 sensor continuously measures the tilt angle of the robot.
The ESP32 processes the sensor data and computes the necessary corrections using the PID algorithm. It then adjusts the motor speeds to keep the robot upright.

PID Control

Proportional (P):
The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. If the robot tilts more, it will correct more aggressively.

Integral (I):
The integral term is concerned with the accumulation of past errors. It helps eliminate the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller.

Derivative (D):
The derivative term is a prediction of future error, based on its rate of change. It helps dampen the response and reduce overshoot.

How It Works

Initialization:
When powered on, the ESP32 initializes the MPU6050 sensor and calibrates it to get accurate readings.
Reading Sensor Data:
In the loop, the ESP32 continuously reads the tilt angle from the MPU6050 sensor.

PID Calculation:
The PID controller computes the correction based on the difference between the desired setpoint (usually 0 degrees) and the current tilt angle.

Motor Control:
Based on the PID output, the ESP32 sends PWM signals to the L298N motor controller, which adjusts the speed and direction of the DC motors to balance the robot.
Challenges and Tuning

PID Tuning:
Achieving a stable balance requires careful tuning of the PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd). This often involves trial and error to find the optimal values that prevent the robot from oscillating or falling over.

Mechanical Design:
The placement of components and the overall design of the robot can affect its balancing performance. Ensuring a low center of gravity and balanced weight distribution is crucial.

This self-balancing robot is a sophisticated project that integrates hardware and software to achieve a challenging task. It provides a practical application of control theory and serves as a foundation for further exploration in robotics.
